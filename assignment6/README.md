# Refresher of hypothesis
There is genetic variation in male mating duration.

1.) Residuals vs. fitted (linearity): 
Since we see basically a perfectly horizontal line, this indicates the relationship is linear (i.e. The residuals of the fitted model have 
a linear relationship with the actual observed values). Therefore a linear model is probably an appropriate choice for analysis.

2.) Normal Q-Q (normality of residuals): 
The residuals follow the straight dashed line relitively well, meaning this is a good indicator that our residuals are normally 
distributed. This further adds to our case that a linear model is an appropriate choice for this data.

3.) Scale-location (heteroscedacity): 
The residuals appear to be randomly spread around a horizonal line, suggesting the dataset is homoscedaitc (i.e. the variances are
relatively similar across means). Another good indication to use a linear model for this data.

4.) Residuals vs. leverage: 
Here, there are clearly no problematic outling residuals that we would have to worry about when using our data in a linear model.
