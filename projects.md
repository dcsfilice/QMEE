# Competitive experience and plasiticy in male-induced harm

Please refer to README.md for a breif background on this topic.

In this project, I study how the effect of previous competition influences male reproductive behaviours, and how these behavioural
differences influence the fitness of the females that they mate with. Additionally, I attempt to quantify the degree of genetic variation
associated with this plasticity. 

# Specfically, I predict:
1.) Males previously housed with rival males will reduce the lifespan of their mates
2.) Males previously housed with rivals and housed alone will have differential on the lifetime offspring production of their mates
3.) There will be signifcant genetic variation associated with both these effects (i.e. in the plasticity)
For the final project I plan on using a combination of mixed model techniques, permutation testing, and perhaps other multivariate statistical methods such as principal component analyses.

# Analysis methods
1.) Primarily, these 3 predictions provide a good oppritunity to work with mixed models. Lifespan can be analyzed with a linear mixed model, and lifetime offspring production with a generalized linear mixed model (poisson distribution).

2.) I see the oppritunity to do some sort of interesting involving estimating selection, perhaps via coefficeints, then gradients? I.e. estimate the total fitness cofficients of each individual female, based on their survivorship and offspring production, then estimate gradients by comparing between the two treatments. I still need to look into this more, but I see it as an interesting oppritunity.
