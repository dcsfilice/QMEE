I hypothesize that males housed with rivals will mate for signifcantly longer compared to males housed alone. The classic way to approach this would be to use a t-test. I will test this by performing a permutation test to generate , 

Furthermore, I hypothesize that there will be significant genetic variation in this effect (i.e. different genetic lines will display variation in this phenotype). The classic way to approach this would be to use an ANOVA. I will test this by using a permutation test to estimate 1000 variance compontents by resampling my data without replacement, then see how often my calculated varience component associated with the random effect of genetic line is greater than or equal to these permutated variance compontents in order to estimate a p-value.
