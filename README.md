# In many species, the context of a social environment can have substantial effects on individual reproductive behaviours.
# In fruit flies, males that are housed in a vial with other competitors (percieve high-risk of sperm competiton) transfer a greater volume of ejaculate compared to flies housed in a vial alone (percieve low-risk of sperm competition).
# The contents of this ejaculate can have negative effects on the fitness of females by reducing their lifespan.
# Therefore, I predict that males housed with rivals will reduce the lifespan of their mates compared to males housed alone.
# Here, I want perform a sereies of survival analyses to analyze test this prediction across six different genetic lines.
# I will achieve this using the select function from the tidyverse package to sort 6 genetic lines into groups, and the coxme function from the coxme package to perform a survival analysis for each genetic line.
