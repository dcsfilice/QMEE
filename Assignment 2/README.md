#Here, I checked my data for mistakes and broke it into seperate tibbles that may be of use during my data analysis. 
When checking for mistakes, I was mostly interested in checking that there were no spelling errors in my variable names, and that each variable combo was replicated the correct number of times. To do this, I used the str, summary, and levels functions. Since the levels function requires variables to be set as factors, I used the mutate function to convert each variable into a factor. This code can be replicated to perform the same function for other datasets, all that has to be done is replace each variable name.
I used ggplot to create a historgram to visualize the distribution of my data. This code can be easily replicated for use with other datasets.
I was also interested in filtering my data by creating a tibble that only included females who survived longer than 21 days.
Lastly, I may be interested in independently analyzing the data for each genetic line (see assignment 1) so I selected new tibbles for each line. Similar to above, this code can easily be used with other data simply by changing the variable names.
