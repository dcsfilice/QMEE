P(A|B) = P(B|A)(A) / P(B)

= (1)(0.01)/1 x 0.01+(0.05)(0.99)

=0.01/0.01+0.0495

=0.01/0.0595

=0.168

=16.8% probability of having MMV

I would tell my friend that his chance of actually having MMV is relatively low so they should not panic from the positive result. I would
simplify my explanation by explaining that in an arbitrary population of 100, we would expect 5 of those to test as false positives, and
only expect one to actually have MMV. Therefore, if picked at random, you are more likely to be a false positive than actually have the
disease. Furthermore, I would explain that in the unlikely case the positive test is true, they could simply use their symptoms to their
advantage by becoming a statistics professor and teach a QMEE course.
